# LDCC and LACC
 DCC for the Lego MindStorms RCX
 * **LDCC**: RCX as a DCC Command Station
 * **LACC**: RCX as a DCC booster -or- a DCC decoder

> [!TIP]
> LDCC capabilities have been merged into [BrickOS](https://github.com/BrickBot/brickOS-bibo);
> however, for a works-out-of-the-box DCC experience, please use this project.
